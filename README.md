# 3d-opengl
A Program made in Java using LWJGL 2 and Slick-Util. This is a Netbeans project.

### What it contains

* LAN multiplayer (high latency, however multiplayer is still possible)
* a 3D world
* background music (it sucks)
* 3d model loading (using triangular faces)
* world loading
    * uses png images to illustrate different blocks and allow for easier world creating (not hardcoding)
* textured quads
* controller input
* pause menu
* inventory system
* collision
* HUD

This is what I was able to code by March 2018 (roughly a 3 and a half month period).
